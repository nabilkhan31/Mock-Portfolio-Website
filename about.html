                <li class="hobby">
                    I like going to the gym as it clears my mind, keeps me healthy and also keeps me in shape. It's also a great way to build discipline.
                </li>
                <li class="hobby">
                    Sketching is another one of my hobbies due to how peaceful it is and how rewarding it feels when you've completed a piece that you're proud of. As well as this, it allows you to express yourself, similar to coding.
                </li>
                <li class="hobby">
                    I also enjoy scouting for new food places. This is mainly because I like trying foods that I haven't tried before as it's always exciting eating food from a different culture.
                </li>
                <li class="hobby">
                    Lastly, I enjoy travelling, From seeing historical monuments that have stood for hundreds of years to just relaxing on the beach watching the waves crash.
